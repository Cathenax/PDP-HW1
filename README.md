### Creative addition
  ### For the addition to the assignment I have added additional functionality when deleting a prompt.
  ### Instead of entering the entire prompt the user can enter a word from the prompt and a list of prompts containing the prompt will be displayed.
  ### Then the user can simply enter the prompt number they want to delete and the prompt will be deleted.

### To run the code 
  ### node main.js
  ### After running the code the test code will be executed.
    ### The record prompt will add some prompts to the interactions
    ### The user will also be asked to enter a word or a sentence from the prompt to delete. (This is part of the creative addition explained in detail below)
    ### After the word (for instance "important") has been entered the list of prompts that have the word will be displayed and the user will be asked to enter the number for the prompt they want to delete.
    ### Then, after the user has enter the number the prompt will be deleted and the remaining prompts will be displayed.
