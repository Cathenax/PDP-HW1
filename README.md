### Creative addition
  - For the addition to the assignment, I have added additional functionality when deleting a prompt.
  - Instead of entering the entire prompt when deletion the user can enter a word from the prompt and a list of prompts containing the word or sentence will be displayed.
  - Then the user can simply enter the prompt number they want to delete and the prompt will be deleted.
  - Note: It is case sensitive. 

### To run the code 
  - node main.js
### After running the code the test code will be executed.
  - The record prompt will add some prompts to the interactions
  - The user will also be asked to enter a word or a sentence from the prompt to delete. (This is part of the creative addition explained above)
  - After the word (for instance "important") has been entered the list of prompts that have the word will be displayed and the user will be asked to enter the number for the prompt they want to delete.
  - Then, after the user has enter the number the prompt will be deleted and the remaining prompts will be displayed.
    
### Note for execution:
  - When the "Enter a word or sentence from the prompt" is displayed you can enter "What" then the list of prompts that contain "What" will be displayed/
  - Then, enter the number of the prompt you want to delete
  - Finally, the list of prompts after removing a prompt will be displayed.
